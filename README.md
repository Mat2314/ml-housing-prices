# ML House Price Prediction
This project is about building a ML model to predict prices of houses in Warsaw.

The aim is to build a model with maximized performance, using PyTorch. Hyperparameters are to be defined during the research.

### Dataset
The dataset can be found in `datasets/warsaw_houses.csv` file. This is a dataset created by scrapping a website with house rental offers. There are just 4 columns:
